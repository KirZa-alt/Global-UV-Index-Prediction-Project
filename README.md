# üåê Global UV Index Prediction

This project predicts the **UV Index (UVI)** based on **geographical and temporal data** using Python. It demonstrates a complete **data science workflow**, including data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, evaluation, and interactive prediction.

## üí† Project Overview

Predicting UVI is crucial for **health, environment, and safety**. This project uses historical global UV data to build models capable of forecasting UVI based on location, time, and other factors.

Key highlights include:

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handled missing values, removed unrealistic UVI values, processed date and time, extracted features like hour, day, month, and season.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized distributions, correlations, and feature relationships via histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, and heatmaps.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Encoded categorical variables (`time_of_day`), mapped months to seasons, applied log and Yeo-Johnson transformations.  
- **Feature Scaling:** StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler applied to numeric features.  
- **Regression Modeling:** Implemented multiple models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Polynomial Regression (non-linear relationships)  
  - Random Forest Regression (ensemble learning)  
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics used: **MSE, RMSE, MAE, R¬≤**, along with cross-validation and predicted vs actual plots.  
- **Model Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning with **GridSearchCV**, feature importance analysis.  
- **Interactive Prediction:** Users can input latitude, longitude, hour, and time of day to get real-time predicted UVI.
